# Decomposition of Genome-Phenome Associations

This repository contains methods for decomposing genetic associations between variants and phenotypes using GWAS summary statistics data. The following methods are included:

1. [Genetic Umixing by Independent Decomposition (GUIDE)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.03.592285v2)

2. [Decomposition of Genetic Associations (DeGAs)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11953-9)

3. [Bayesian Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (bNMF)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30240442/).

The first two methods are extensively compared, with a particular focus a GUIDE. The implementation of GUIDE has been extended through the use of ICASSO framework. Details on this extension can be found in the file 'Thesis.pdf'.
