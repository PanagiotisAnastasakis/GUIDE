# Decomposition of Genome-Phenome Associations

This repository contains methods for decomposing genetic associations between variants and phenotypes using GWAS summary statistics data. The following methods are included:

1. [Genetic Umixing by Independent Decomposition (GUIDE)][https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.03.592285v2].



first method is [Decomposition of Genetic Associations (DeGAs)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11953-9),

is extensively compared with  \href{https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.03.592285v2}{here}

the implementation of GUIDE, a method for decomposing genetic associations using GWAS summary statistics data. Details of the method can be found \href{https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.03.592285v2}{here}.
